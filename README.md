<h2 > About Me </h2>
I graduated in the field of mathematics with data analytics.
 I had Python and R-Programming in the applied component. 
In the three years of degree program I learned about calculus,
 linear & abstract algebra, real & complex analysis, metric spaces.
 The two years data analytics course included topics like statistics, probability, databases,
 machine learning algorithms, introdctory artificial intelligence. 
I enjoy playing with data, I like to generate insights from it and to make predictive models.
 I am a quick learner and I like to learn new technologies. My aim is to be in the field of data driven astronomy where I can use my knowledge of astronomy, data science and mathematics for space research.
